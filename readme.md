#TextMate/Sublime Language

This package provides syntax highlighting for the SublimeText JSON/YAML tmlanguage files in VsCode. The syntax highlighting uses 
tmLanguage files sourced from https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev.
 
This package has no capability to convert between JSON/YAML and standard PLIST tmlanguage files. If this is required, SublimeText 
PackageDev is recommended.
